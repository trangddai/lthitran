                <blockquote> Hi, I'm Thi Trang Le but people usually know me as Trang. I'm a student of Information System Technology at Northern Virginia Community Collegeworking, towards earning their A.A.S. degree in this field, and currently working as a DCO at AWS. I have a zest for traveling, exploring new places with different cultures. My dream travel destinations are Switzerland and Hawaii. Switzerland has majestic mountains, and picturesque cities, while Hawaii offers stunning beaches, lush tropical scenery, and a vibrant island culture. I also find joy in gardening, perhaps I enjoy tending to them in my garden, watching them bloom and brighten up the surroundings. Among the flowers, I have a special fondness for carnations and tulips. Carnations are cherished for their delicate petals and sweet fragrance, while tulips are known for their vibrant colors and graceful appearance.</blockquote>
